# Guess My Number Game ðŸŽ²

## Project Description

"Guess My Number" is a simple and interactive number-guessing game implemented using React. The player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. The game provides feedback whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. The player wins if they guess the correct number, and the score is tracked to set a high score.

## Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 20.
- User input for guessing the number.
